    <h1>Exercise 2.12</h1>
    <p>In Example 2.7, there's a system (an array) of Mover objects and one
        Attractor object. Build an example that has systems of both movers
        and attractors. What if you make the attractors invisible? Can you
        create a pattern / design from the trails of objects moving around
        attractors?
