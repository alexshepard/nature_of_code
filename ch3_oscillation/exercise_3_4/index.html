    <h1>Exercise 3.4</h1>
    <p>
        Create a simulation of a vehicle that you can drive
        around the screen by using the arrow keys: the left
        arrow accelerates the car to the left, and the right
        arrow accelerates to the right. The car should point
        in the direction in which it's currently moving.
