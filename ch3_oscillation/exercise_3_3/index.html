    <h1>Exercise 3.3</h1>
    <p>
        Step 1. Create a simulation of objects being shot out of
        a cannon. Each object should experience a sudden force
        (just once) as well as gravity (always present).
        <br />
        Step 2. Add rotation to the object to model its spin as
        it's shot from the cannon. How realistic can you make it
        look?
